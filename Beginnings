	<h1>Testing Heading 1</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Testing paragraph 1</p>
		<p2>Using paragraphs helps adjust text in different sections, but using the "div" function allows you to divide your page into sections and make it easier to group elements in your HTML together.</p2>
	</div>
	<div id="attributes">
		<h1>Attributes and Grouping Your Code</h1>
			<h3>Using Div IDs, also known as attributes</h3>
				<p>A commonly used Attribute is "id"</p>
				<p2>Using attributes requires the <i>name</i> of the attribute, and the <i>value</i> of the attribute. You can use "id" to specify different contact (such as s div), and this is really helpful when you use an element more than once.</p2>
				<p3>If you will inspect the Div for this paragraph, you will notice the ID is equal to "attributes." That means that this entire division is referred to as Attributes, and I can use that ID to reference this element. When IDs are added to a DIV, then we place it in the opening tag.</p3>
		<h3>Using Spans, The Inline "Div"</h3>
			<p>You have the normal paragraph format of using "p" and then you have <span>SPANS</span></p>
			<p2>Spans are better for when you want to target a specific piece of inline text, AKA something that is on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, then it is better to use a DIV.</p2>
			<p3>A good example of why you may use a "span" is so that you can style one part of a paragraph different from another when implementing other languages such as CSS.</p3>
	</div>
	<div id="formatting">
		<h1>You can also use formatting to assist with your text!</h1>
		<h3>Line Breaks</h3>
			<p>You can use line breaks with the "br" command, for axample <br><br> this is a line break (technically two, if you want the space in between lines), and you don't need a closing tag for it. <br><br> break <br> as many <br> times <br> as you <br> want.</p>
		<h3>Using Text Formats</h3>
			<p2>You should also learn to alter text with commands such as "strong" or "em" which are the equivalent of "bold" and "italicize", respectively. You can "em" text to <em>emphasize</em> text, or you can make text <strong>strong</strong> to embolden it.</p2>
			<p3>Alternatively, a lot of programming languages recognize "i" for "<i>italicize</i>" and "b" for "<b>bold</b>. You should also consider "u" for <u>underlining</u>.</p3>
		<h3>Lists</h3>
			<h4>Unordered Lists</h4>
				<p>Here is a little bit of information on how to use unordered lists! Unordered lists use "ul" (literally just an abbreviation of it), and then once you start that tag, each line item is "li". This will often make bullet points.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Line Item 1</li>
						<li>Item 2</li>
						<li>3</li>
					</ul>
			<h4>Ordered Lists</h4>
				<p>Additionally, you can use ordered lists, which use the "ol" command (yet another abbreviation), and will use the same line item "li" command as unordered lists.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Line Item 1</li>
						<li>Item 2</li>
						<li>3</li>
					</ol>
	</div>
	<div id="Supplementary Items">
		<h3>Images</h3>
			<p>Many images will use the search function to search for an image. with has the command, the attribute, and the source.<br><br> Command = "img"<br>attribute = "src" (AKA Search)<br>Source = [In most instances this will be the URL of the image.]</p>
			<p>For example, like this:<br><br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GVJ06OK.jpg" alt="An edited photo of Rami Malek, across a vaporwave background featuring grids, a galaxy, and chrome letters reading 'hackerman' in all caps."/><br>
				<i>Hope you guys like my favorite actor Rami Malek</i><br><br>
				If you'd like to know what that command looked like, let me type it out for you with extra spaces inserted:
				[< img src = "https://i.imgur.com/GVJ06OK.jpg" / >]
			</p>
			<h4>Alternative Text For Images</h4>
				<p>Additionally, since the web has become more useful and inclusive for individuals with disabilites, we should learn how to use things such as "Alternative Text."<br><br>Here are some other functions that an "alt" attribute can be used for.
					<ul>
						<li>A description of the image so that visually impaired users can have a text to speach option for the image.</li>
						<li>If an image fails to load, the user can mouse over the area where the image was intended to be, and can read a brief description of the image.</li>
						<li>Improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because search engines cannot "see" images, so the text description can improve the ranking of your site in the search results.</li>
					</ul>
					The command for using an alternative text on an image [< img src"Image_URL_Here" alt="Your Description here"/ >]
				</p>
			<h3>Videos</h3>
				<p>Videos also use the same search funtion as photos, but with a little extra depth. You have the "video" command, with the "src" search attribute, and then your video URL as the source, but then you also add the Width and Heigt attributes, and add their values in pixels. However, the difference is that "video" is not a self closing tag like "img." We will need to close the tag with a backslash, and then we'll be all set.</p>
				<p2>For example, your command would look someone like this <br><br>[Video src="URL_HERE"][/video]<br><br>If you would like to include controls on the video, or define it's width and height, then it will look something like this:<br><br>[Video src="URL_HERE" width="number" height="number" controls][/video]</p2><br><br>
				<p3>Lastly, you can display a message if the video is not displayed or supported. Here is how that will look:<br><br>[Video src="URL_HERE" width="number" height="number" controls] Video not supported text here[/video]<br><br>And here is that in action:<br><br><Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpUWQVx1PnU" width="640" height="480" controls> Your browser is a binch and doesn't support memes.</video>
